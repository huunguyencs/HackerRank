# Task:
# The manager of a industrial plant is planning to buy
# a machine of either type A or type B. For each dayâ€™s
# operation:

# + The number of repairs, X, that machine A needs is a
# Poisson random variable with mean 0.88.The daily cost
# of operating A is C(A) = 160 + 40X^2.

# + The number of repairs, Y, that machine B needs is a
# Poisson random variable with mean 1.55.The daily cost
# of operating B is C(B) = 128 + 40Y^2.

# Assume that the repairs take a negligible amount of time
# and the machines are maintained nightly to ensure that
# they operate like new at the start of each day. Find and
# print the expected daily cost for each machine.
